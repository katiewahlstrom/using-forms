What are the benefits/disadvantages of using some tags over others? 
    -I am not quite sure yet, they are all blending together and I am still trying to figure out which to use when, but 
    I am guessing that certain tags are beneficial because of their user friendliness. 

How do you start to use the data provided by the user programmatically?
    I can not find the information on this.  I am assuming it will be sent somewhere, but I can not find where.  

    *I followed a online tutorial for the "register" form, and was really excited with how it looked and turned out.  It looked 
    way better than I expected it to!  However, I was unable to create the same look with the login form and the forgot password form. I tried to for several hours on Saturday, but I just can't make them look good!  I am hoping that next week the CSS classes will help.
